## 2018-08-30

This project, htdp-2e, keeps track of my learning proccess of the book **How the Design Programs, 2nd edition**, including my thoughts, notes and solutions to the exercises. My final goal is to create a *Python version* of htdp.

The [book](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/) is available online,

as well as the [programming environment](http://racket-lang.org/) used in the book.
